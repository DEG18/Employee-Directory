### Description
- For this assignment, I created a employee directory with React. I break up this application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

- An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name, email, phonenumber and DOB.
